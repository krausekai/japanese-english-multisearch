updater.js
- Update the program by downloading the changed app data (html, css, js) instead of needing to download a new compiled build
	Size of core files is insignificant, and would be a welcome change to update by only downloading core changes if possible.

webscraper.js
- Separate file better, perhaps into 2-3 files, and clean up code
- Separate as an 'api' file, to differentiate front-end and back-end more?

General
- Remove third-party dependencies for requests?

Entries
- drop-down menus to save terms to file? (relies on HTML data)
